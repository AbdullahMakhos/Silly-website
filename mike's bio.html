             Woof! Hi there! I’m Mike, the cutest dog around! 🐶 I might not 
             be the brightest pup in the park, but I sure know how to have a
             good time! My tail wags like crazy whenever I see a squirrel or
             a stick—oh boy, I love sticks! 
             I might get a little confused sometimes, like when
             I bark at my own reflection or chase my tail for way
             too long, but that just makes me more lovable, right? If you throw a ball, I’ll chase it... eventually! 
             Let’s go sniff some grass or find some treats—I'm ready for an adventure! What do you wanna do? Woof! 🦴✨</p>
